# Calculate Personal Daily Calorie Intake

The Harris-Benedict formula is used to describe your basal metabolic rate (BMR)
as a numeric value.

## Calculate Your BMR

women:

```
BMR = 655.1 + (9.563 x weight in kg) + (1.850 x height in cm) - (4.676 x age in years)
```

men:

```
BMR = 66.47 + (13.75 x weight in kg) + (5.003 x height in cm) - (6.755 x age in years)
```

For me the formula on the 2022-08-17 will look like: `1207.72 + 875.525 - 175.63`  
and the result will be: `1907.615`

## Calculate Your ARM

Your AMR represents the number of calories you need to consume each day to stay
at your current weight. If you want to lose weight, you need to increase your
level of physical activity or decrease your caloric intake by eating less.

**ARM levels:**

- Sedentary (little or no exercise): AMR = **BMR x 1.2**
- Lightly active (exercise 1–3 days/week): AMR = **BMR x 1.375**
- Moderately active (exercise 3–5 days/week): AMR = **BMR x 1.55**
- Active (exercise 6–7 days/week): AMR = **BMR x 1.725**
- Very active (hard exercise 6–7 days/week): AMR = **BMR x 1.9**

For me the formula on the 2022-08-17 will look like: `1907.615 * 1.375`
with a result of: `2622.970625`

That means that I burn `2623` calories a day.

An online calculator can be used to calculate your daily calories. For me the results
where really similar to these, being `2469` calories a day.

**Important note:**  
The BMR calculations can be non-exact. If you want to be **extra** sure about it,
the first week (7 days) eat the exact amount of calories that your AMR results show.

Of course
doing the amount of exercise that you do normally, so the ARM level matches. If
at the end of the week you lose weight, that means you need to add some calories to the
ARM (+250 maybe) and if you gain weight, that means you need to remove some calories.
This is an important step, and exact ARM will make the calculations on the long
run much easier

## Cut the calorie intake

There are multiple ways you can approach your cut, but if you are interested
on losing only fat and not much muscle I would recommend the "Slow and steady"
approach. This is good for metabolism too.

You can start cutting 300 calories from your daily calories. In my case that means
`2469 - 300` = `2169` calories a day.

It can happen that after some time the weight loss plateaus, in that case we have
multiple options:

- Rest 100 to 200 calories of the daily calorie intake
- Add a cardio session to the weekly routine. e.g. From 2 cardio sessions a week to 3
- Increase the cardio time (+5 or +10 minutes) of the week current cardio sessions

Any of these options will help you to lose weight again.

## Cardio

- The best moment of the day to do cardio is when waking up while fasting or
  immediately after a workout.
- If you don't know how much cardio to do per week, a good start can be 1 or 2
  sessions of 20 to 30 minutes. Ideally keeping the hearth rate to 140 BPM during
  the duration of the session
- Gaining muscle mass helps fat loss. So workouts are equally important to cardio

# Diets

Choose the one that works bests for you, the most important part is that you stick
to it for some time to check if it works or not. The main **ingredient** for fat lose
is counting and cutting the calories.

**Important notes:**

- Protein intake before and after workouts is helpful for muscle gain.
- You can choose different approaches on how to split the daily meals, you can
  do some intermittent fasting (16x8), you can do 5 meals a day or even just 1.
  The important part is that you stick to the approach you choose.

## Macro split

Like diets needs to be tested, but for weight loss purposes, a moderate-fat (20% to 30% of calories), moderate
carb (30% to 40% of calories), and a high protein diet (25% to 35% of calories)
tend to work for most people.
